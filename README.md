# Neural network models with python

Welcome to the repository of various machine learning projects. Each subfolder contains a specific project with its own detailed description.

## Subfolders

1. **[fashion_mnist](fashion_mnist/)**
    - This folder contains a project focused on classifying images from the Fashion MNIST dataset. Fashion MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article images. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes.

2. **[gtsrb](gtsrb/)**
    - The German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) project focuses on recognizing traffic signs. This dataset includes more than 50,000 images of 43 different traffic signs. The project aims to build a model capable of accurately classifying these signs.

3. **[imdb_one_hot](imdb_one_hot/)**
    - This project involves sentiment analysis on the IMDB movie reviews dataset. It uses one-hot encoding for text preprocessing and then classify movie reviews as positive or negative. The dataset contains 50,000 reviews divided equally into training and testing sets.

4. **[mnist_nn](mnist_nn/)**
    - This project implements a neural network to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. MNIST is a classic dataset consisting of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9), each 28x28 pixels in size.

5. **[rnn](rnn/)**
    - The Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) project explores sequence prediction tasks. RNNs are well-suited for tasks involving sequential data. This folder contains an example and implementation of RNN applied to an own made data.

## How to Use
